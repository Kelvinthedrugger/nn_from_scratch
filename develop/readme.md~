 add dropout: restore-release part and voila

 add monitor of training also, might be a good practice to wrap up .py into .exe

 custom forward pass, starts from convolution

 for efficiency:

  configure the layers with 'dict', since dict is run by reference, which should save us some time 

  at the update-weight step (where optimizer takes action), instead of redeclare the weights 

  and assign them to the model in the training loop

f

 super hard: 

  modularize all the stuff to deploy auto differentiation without hand-coded 

  procedures of backprop everytime a new model is establish
