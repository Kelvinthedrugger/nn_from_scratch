 add dropout: restore-release part and voila

 add monitor of training also, might be a good practice to wrap up .py into .exe

 custom forward pass, starts from convolution


 for efficiency:

   configure the layers with 'dict', since dict is run by reference, which should save us some time 

   at the update-weight step (where optimizer takes action), instead of redeclare the weights 

   and assign them to the model in the training loop


 Graph

   input --> layer 1 --> layer 2 --> ... --> layer n --> output
   							
	   					     gradient <-- loss
       d_layer 1 <- d_layer 2 <- ... <- d_layer n

   To compute gradient: 

   super hard: 

     modularize all the stuff to deploy auto differentiation without hand-coded 

     procedures of backprop everytime a new model is establish
